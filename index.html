             Conway called this game life, because of its analogies with the rise, fall and
             alternatios of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing class of
             what are called Simulation-Games.that resemble real-life processes.
             
             The basic idea is to start with a simple configuration of counters (organisms),
             one to a cell, then observe how it changes as you apply Conway's genetic laws, 
             for births, deaths and survivals. conway chose his rules carefully.

             Conways's genetic laws are delightfully simple. First note that each cell od the 
             checkboard has eight neighboring cells, four adjacent orthogonally, four ajacent 
             diagonally. These rules are: 

             1. Survivals. Every counter with two or three neighbors counters survives for the next gneneration
             2. Deaths. Each counter with four or more neighbors dies from overpopulation. 
                Every counter with one neighbor or nonoe dies from isolation.
             3. Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors -- no more. no fewer
                is a birth cell. A counter is placed on it at the next move.
